# AWS SSO

[AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/index.html) is a cloud service that enables you to manage SSO access to your AWS accounts, resources, and cloud applications centrally, for users from your preferred identity source.

When you enable AWS SSO, you allow it to create IAM roles for each AWS account in your AWS organization. You also allow other AWS accounts within your organization to assign applications access to AWS SSO users. (from products page)

Your identity source is the place where you administer and authenticate identities. You use AWS SSO to manage permissions for identities from your identity source to access AWS accounts, roles, and applications. AWS has three main identity sources: AWS SSO; Active Directory (AWS hosted or on-premise), or external SAML 2.0-compatible identity provider (IdP) such as [Octka](https://www.okta.com/products/single-sign-on/), [Azure AD][https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/services/active-directory/], [Ping](https://www.pingidentity.com/en/software/pingfederate.html), or [OneLogin](https://www.onelogin.com/product/sso).
